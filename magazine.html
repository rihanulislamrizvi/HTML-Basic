    <pre align="center"><h3>Since the last update to the recommended builds, AMD has released new CPUs and GPUs 
        to tackle Intel and NVidia. The Radeon RX 6650 XT, RX 6750 XT, and RX 6950 XT are 
        mid-generation refreshes of original RX 6000 models that boost performance slightly 
        thanks to higher clock speeds, but at slight price premiums over the vanilla cards. On 
        the processor front, the Ryzen 5 5500, 5600, Ryzen 7 5700X and 5800X3D are the new 
        kids on the block, but they're up against stiff competition with Intel's strong 12th gen.</h3></pre>
